## Introduction
This project focuses on designing a local area network for the City Hall, ensuring efficient IT systems and adequate bandwidth for both wired and wireless users.

## Company Profile
- **General Information**: The City Hall manages local community affairs and provides public services to residents.
- **Location and Buildings**: The City Hall consists of two buildings located 100 meters apart, connected via a single-mode optical link.

## Project Objective
The objective is to design a LAN that is scalable, highly available, and capable of improving the efficiency of IT systems while accommodating the needs of different workgroups.

## Resource Inventory
- **Devices Used**: Printers, WiFi access points, and wireless devices.
- **Servers**: Web Server and FTP Server.
- **Bandwidth Requirements**: Detailed calculations for bandwidth requirements for each workgroup.

## Analysis of User Needs
A thorough analysis of user needs was conducted to tailor the network characteristics to the requirements of the City Hall, including backbone connections, local server connections, and internet connections.

## Design Assumptions
- Ethernet-based technologies are preferred.
- Wireless access is available on specified floors.
- Traffic within workgroups is separated using VLANs.
- Multi-layer security measures are implemented.

## Network Design
The network design is based on a hierarchical topology, ensuring performance, security, and ease of management. Each building has logically separated distribution points and a main distribution point.

## Device Configuration Plan
A detailed configuration plan for network devices, including routers, switches, and access points, is provided to ensure optimal performance and management.

## Catalog Sheets of Proposed Devices
This section includes catalog sheets for the proposed devices, detailing specifications and configurations.
